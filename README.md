## Setup Instructions

### Firebase Setup

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Add your app to the project (Android/iOS)
3. Download the `firebase_options.dart` file from the Firebase Console
4. Place the file in the `lib` directory
5. Enable Authentication and Firestore in your Firebase project
6. Set up Firebase App Check for additional security

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Set up Firebase configuration as described above
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Security Considerations

- Never commit your `firebase_options.dart` file to version control
- Use Firebase App Check to prevent unauthorized access
- Implement proper security rules in Firebase Console
- Use encryption for sensitive data
- Follow secure coding practices
